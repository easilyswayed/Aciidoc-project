In this guide I will tell you about the Asciidoc markup technique. 

=== Paragraphs

Paragraphs don't have special markup,they are defined by one or more consecutive lines. 

There should be at least one blank line when a new paragraph begins.

This is a normal paragraph that follows source format rules.

=== Multiple indentions in paragraph

[verse, Oscar Wilde, from The Ballad of Reading Gaol]
He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day

===  Text styles
These are text styles, used to define word meanings.

* normal text, _italicized_, *bolded*, +monotext+.
* ``double quotes'', `single quote'.
* normal, ^super text^, ~sub text~.
* `passthrough *bolded*`

Quotes

‘Text with a single quote’
Text with one `single grave accent at the left and one acute accent to the right' show in single quotation marks
“Text with a double quote”
Text with ``two grave accents to the left and two acute accents to the right'' show in double quation marks
