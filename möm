In this guide I will tell you about the Asciidoc markup technique. 

=== Paragraphs

In Asciidoc, paragraphs of text don't have special markup. Lines of text is a considered a paragraph when they are one or more consecutive lines of text. 

For clarity there should be at least one blank line when a new paragraph begins.

This is a normal paragraph that follows source format rules. You can see that the line above is separated by a small space as separate paragraphs.

=== Multiple indentions in paragraph

This is how a block of text with a separate intended source information shows up in Asciidoc.

[verse, Oscar Wilde, from The Ballad of Reading Gaol]
He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day

By identifying it as a verse, we have the intended format with name of the author and name of the poem.

===  Text styles
These are different text styles used in Asciidoc. They are used to give words meaning and emphasis.

* normal text, _italicized_, *bolded*, +monotext+.
* ``double quotes'', `single quote'.

===  Lists

Lists in Asciidoc are unordered or ordered.

This is an unordered list

* Level 1 item
** Level 2 item
*** Level 3 item
**** Level 4 item
***** Level 5 item
* Level 1 item

As you can see, same level items do not need to be consecutive.

This is an ordered list. The definitions of list items give more information than in an unordered list.

. Level 1 list item
.. Level 2 list item
... Level 3 list item
.... Level 4 list item
..... Level 5 list item
. Level 1 list item

Checklist

* [*] checked
* [x] also checked
